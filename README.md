## Course content:

### Fundamentals
<p>
Students learn technical tools and fundamentals to use throughout their careers. From general knowledge of how a computer and the internet works, to handling a terminal and tools like GIT. It will also introduce students to the world of programming from two different paradigms: on the one hand, imperative programming, where we will work in Javascript, and object-oriented programming, in Java.
</p>

### Front-end
<p>
The part of an application that interacts with the user, that is, on the client side, is called the front-end. This involves both the graphical interface and the interaction presented to the user, among other things. Along the axis, the student will learn how to develop the layout of a website in HTML and CSS, using the best practices in the market. In the process, Javascript will be incorporated as a scripting language, allowing the page to respond interactively and dynamically.
</p>

### Back-end
<p>
This is the database-bound part that manages all development operating from the server. In this stack, students work with the Java language, including Spring for the creation and presenting the MVC design pattern as the main guide. Monolithic applications will be explored: those oriented to microservices and the different approaches on the market. Creating APIs, session management and using an ORM are learnt to interact with the database.
</p>

### Infrastructure
<p>
A fundamental task of a Developer is to understand the ecosystem where a technological solution is built, in addition to its alternatives, costs, scalability and maintenance, among other factors.
</p>

### Database
<p>
Throughout the training, students learn how relational (SQL) and non-relational databases work, taking into account the theoretical framework, their conception, launch, maintenance, operation and performance.
</p>

### Soft skills training
<p>
Soft skills are related to the behavior of each person, linked much more to personality and experiences than to professional training itself. Therefore, during the course, we offer a variety of workshops, including learning agility, collaboration and teamwork, time management, effective communication and professional attitude.
