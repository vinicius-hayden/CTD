### Checkpoint purpose

The purpose of this checkpoint is to use the concepts of object direction presented during the semester. You must implement as modeled classes
in the class diagram and send all the system's source code.

1. Basic Characteristics 
   - The program should be object oriented.
   - Use the console in order to receive user inputs.
   - All classes present in the diagram should be implemented in the source code.
2. Topics of the discipline that should be covered and that will be evaluated in the project:
   - Classes(Attributes and methods), Constructors, Encapsulation.
   - Implement Overload and Override.
   - Implement Collections concepts(List or Set).
   - Implement Exceptions concepts (RuntimeException and custom)
3. Extra Characteristics
   - Code comments for better comprehension and understanding.
   - If any change is made in the class diagrams, please send the diagram again alongside the code.
