### Checkpoint purpose

The purpose of this checkpoint is to use the object-oriented concepts presented so far. In this first part you must send a proposal describing the application scenario, its class diagram and its implementation in Java. The checkpoint can be done in pairs or individually.

1. Basic Characteristics 
   - Create a problem and develop a solution
   - The text containing the purpose definition should contain at least 3 paragraphs:
     - An introduction explaining the overall problem;
     - A paragraph describing the application scenario;
     - One or more paragraphs with enough data to solve the problem;
2. Class Diagrams
   - The diagram must contain at least 4 classes, with the exception of the main method
   -  Presentation of the class diagram with attributes, methods, data types and the relationships between classes;
   -  It must be described in the class diagram what is the encapsulation of the attributes and methods (public, private, protected)
